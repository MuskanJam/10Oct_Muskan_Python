What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person?

A subclass relationship is appropriate for the relationship between Student and Person.

Inheritance Relationship:
A Student is a specific type of Person. Therefore, it makes sense to model this relationship using inheritance, where the Student class inherits attributes and methods from the Person class.

Code Reusability:
By defining common attributes and behaviors in the Person class, you can reuse them in the Student class without duplicating code. This promotes code reuse and simplifies maintenance.

Polymorphism:
Inheritance allows for polymorphic behavior, where methods defined in the Person class can be overridden in the Student class to provide specialized behavior.
