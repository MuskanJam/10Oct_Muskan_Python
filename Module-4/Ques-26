What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?

In object-oriented programming (OOP), instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance (object) of a class. When you instantiate a class, you are essentially creating a specific realization or occurrence of that class, which has its own unique set of attributes and methods.

Class Definition: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.

Instantiation: When you instantiate a class, you create a specific instance of that class in memory. 

Object Creation: Each instance created through instantiation is a separate and independent entity with its own state (attributes) and behavior (methods). 

Usage: Once instantiated, you can use the object to access its attributes and methods.
